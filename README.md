# Seekers Bot

Discord Bot has the following functions:

1. Message embeds: Messages sent by the bot are different/visually better than normal messages.
2. Reaction roles: Below the message of the “rules” is an emoji. When this emoji is pressed by the user, the user gets a “memeber” role, which exempts different channels for users with that role.
3. Daily wordle: Every day at midnight an embed message is sent with a link to wordle game. This is so that the users can play that game and share their results.
4. Every time I go live on twitch, it is posted: self-explanatory, a message embed is sent from the livestream with some extra info (title, number of viewers and which game is being played)
